## Testing

We will be running a smoke test as preliminary testing that comprises a set of non-exhaustive tests that verify that the build is stable enough for further testing.

As we are building a currency converter, it is important to check that the mathmematical functions work

## UI Design

We will be using A/B testing to decide the UI will will be choosing for the currecny converter. James will be creating a google form where the team will pick out the better UI out of the two designs.

## Testing Review

We decided to use JEST because we were comfortable with this testing framework. Our first testing was smoke test (to test the initial testing).

We decided to work on testing our individual functions before incooperating the HTML/CSS so we can focus on making our functions work. We also discussed the different testing we could include. For example, because this is a currency convertor we have to ensure it is being written in the correct formation (2.d.p)
